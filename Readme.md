Here's a `README.md` file for your project based on the provided database schema and queries:

# Assignment Portal

This project is an **Assignment Portal** where users (students) can register, submit assignments, and manage them. The portal includes a database for storing user details, assignment submissions, and assignment information. The system supports user authentication, assignment submission, and viewing assignment details.

## Database Structure

The project uses the following tables:

### 1. `users`
This table stores the registered students' details.
- `id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT) - Primary Key
- `student_id` (VARCHAR(50), UNIQUE, NOT NULL) - The unique identifier for each student.
- `password` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL) - The password for the student.

### 2. `submissions`
This table stores information about assignments that have been submitted by students.
- `id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT) - Primary Key
- `student_id` (INT, NOT NULL) - ID of the student who submitted the assignment.
- `assignment_name` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL) - Name of the assignment.
- `assignment_image` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL) - Image related to the assignment.
- `submission_time` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - Timestamp of when the assignment was submitted.

### 3. `assignments`
This table stores the assignment details for each student.
- `id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT) - Primary Key
- `student_id` (INT, NOT NULL) - ID of the student submitting the assignment.
- `name` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL) - Name of the assignment.
- `subject` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL) - Subject of the assignment.
- `file_link` (VARCHAR(500), NOT NULL) - Link to the assignment file.
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - Timestamp of when the assignment was created.

## SQL Queries

### Create Tables
Run the following SQL queries to create the necessary tables in your database (`assignment_portal`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE submissions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT NOT NULL,
    assignment_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    assignment_image VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    submission_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE assignments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_link VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Insert Sample Data
To insert some sample data into the `users` table, run the following SQL queries:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (student_id, password) VALUES ('37201', 'admin1122');
INSERT INTO users (student_id, password) VALUES ('67890', 'testpassword');
INSERT INTO users (student_id, password) VALUES ('11111', 'mypassword');
```

## How to Use

1. **Database Setup**: 
   - Create a MySQL database named `assignment_portal`.
   - Run the SQL queries provided above to create the necessary tables and insert sample data.

2. **User Registration**: 
   - A student can register by providing their `student_id` and `password`.
   
3. **Assignment Submission**:
   - Students can submit assignments by uploading the assignment file and providing the assignment details.
   
4. **View Assignments**: 
   - Students can view the assignments they have submitted and the details of the assignments.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP** (for backend logic)
- **MySQL** (for database management)
- **HTML** (for frontend structure)
